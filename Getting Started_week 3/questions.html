            <p>
              Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities
              which use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of
              water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of
              rough water. Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience.

              In case you weren't aware, whitewater rafting can be one of the
              most adrenaline-pumping, thrill-seeking activities out there. From
              watching the horizon line disappear out of sight, signaling that
              you're about to drop 15 feet in 6 seconds, to paddling for your
              life through Class IV+ rapids, it's a wild ride.

          <h1 class="faq-page">How many people fit in a raft?</h1>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
              In general, six to seven guests plus the guide will fit in a raft.
              The number of guests per raft can vary depending on the size of
              the guests and river flows. River Runners has some boats that fit
              up to nine people at moderate to high flows.
